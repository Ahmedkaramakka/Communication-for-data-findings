# Communication-for-data-findings
I chose a Prosper loan data then tried to clean and asked some questions trying to answer it through my analysis 

- the exploratory analysis was overwhelming there were 81 features(columns) associated with each loan
I investigated the employment status duration and it was right skewed giving that maximum portion we have is 200 months that means that until 15 years of working there are some people applying for loans
The prosperscore distribution was likely a normal distribution
Most of our loans are 36 months which is 3 years
The main finding that are you a home owner or not , accompanied with the prosperscore, the term of the loan and the listing category which is the reason of the loan, all of these affects the borrower rate I chose these criteria as they were obviously affecting the borrower rate from one case to another
-feedback obtained from one of my family
He has no engineering or software background so he commented on the visualization asking me to chance the label of x axis in some of them to make it interpretable to anyone
-list of resources:
I used the documentation of matplot lib and pandas in few cases
